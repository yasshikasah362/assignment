## 📝 Process

I started by listing the essential features I wanted in a task manager, drawing inspiration from popular tools like Trello and Notion. The development process began with setting up the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle user authentication and task management.

Once the backend was ready, I moved on to setting up Vite for the frontend and integrating it with React and JavaScript. I focused on creating a user-friendly dashboard that allowed easy task management with drag-and-drop functionality. The styling was handled using Tailwind CSS, making the interface clean and responsive.

The most challenging part was implementing the drag-and-drop functionality and ensuring that the changes were reflected in the backend and persisted on page refresh. Learning how to efficiently manage state across different components was also a significant part of the process. Since it was my first time building a fullstack application using MERN, I found it challenging but equally rewarding to implement authentication features and security using packages such as JWT and bcrypt🔐.

## 📁 Environment Setup
- **Frontend**: A sample environment file is located in the `frontend` folder. It includes placeholders for environment variables used by the React application.
- **Backend**: A sample environment file is located in the `backend` folder. It includes placeholders for environment variables used by the Node.js/Express application.

Please make sure to replace the placeholders in these `.env.sample` files with your actual values in the `.env` files to run the application successfully.
